# **Back-Office Business Management App**

## **Overview**

This app is designed for small businesses to streamline and manage various back-office business operations. It provides a user-friendly interface to manage customers, track sales and invoices, monitor inventory, manage expenses, track jobs and tasks, and manage employee work hours. The application is built using **Streamlit** and integrates with **MongoDB** for data storage and management.

The app is divided into the following pages:

1. **Dashboard** (`01_Dashboard.py`): 
   - Displays a summary of important business metrics like total revenue, expenses, and task/job completion status.
   - MongoDB collections accessed: `invoices`, `expenses`, `jobs`.

2. **Customer Management** (`02_Customer_Management.py`):
   - Displays a list of customers and allows adding new customers to the system.

- **Backend**: MongoDB (NoSQL Database)
- **Hosting**: Heroku (for cloud deployment)

### **MongoDB Collections**
The application interacts with the following MongoDB collections:
- **customers**: Stores customer data (name, contact information, and purchase history).
- **invoices**: Tracks invoices (invoice number, customer ID, amount, date, status).
- **expenses**: Stores expense records (description, category, amount, vendor).
- **jobs**: Manages tasks and jobs (job title, location, employee assigned, status).

### **Installation Guide**

#### **Prerequisites**
1. **Python 3.7+** must be installed on your system.
2. **MongoDB** instance for storing application data.
3. **Heroku CLI** (for deployment to Heroku).

#### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/your-back-office-app.git
cd your-back-office-app
```

#### **Step 2: Install Dependencies**
Create a virtual environment and install required packages:
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate virtual environment (macOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### **Step 3: Set Up MongoDB Connection**
Create a `secrets.toml` file in the `.streamlit` directory to store your MongoDB connection information:
```bash
mkdir -p .streamlit
```

Inside `.streamlit/secrets.toml`, add your MongoDB connection string:
```toml
[mongo]
mongo_connection_string = "your_mongodb_connection_string"
db = "your_database_name"
```

#### **Step 4: Run the Application Locally**
```bash
streamlit run 01_Dashboard.py
```

#### **Step 5: Deploy to Heroku**
1. Create a new Heroku app:
    ```bash
    heroku create your-app-name
    ```

2. Set up environment variables for MongoDB in Heroku:
    ```bash
    heroku config:set MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING="your_mongodb_connection_string"
    heroku config:set DB_NAME="your_database_name"
    ```

3. Deploy the app:
    ```bash
    git push heroku main
    ```

4. Open the app:
    ```bash
    heroku open
    ```
